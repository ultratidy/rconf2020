## Things I Learned at rconf

San Francisco has a homeless problem.  

There were about 20 different workshops.  Workshop slides and scrips can be reviewed here: <https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020>.

There were several talks detailing tips and tricks for using R.  Unfortunately, the slide decks were not aggregated for sharing.  


## Slide with Bullets

- Create a package
